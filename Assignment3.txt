1. OSC 7.16
a. Increase Available(new resources added)
It’s safe all the time. It cannot put the system into unsafe state

b. Decrease Available(resource permanently removed from system)
It’s safe only when Max<=Available. Remove resources may put the system into an unsafe sat


c. Increase Max for one process(the process needs more resources than allowed , it may want more)
It’s safe only when Max<=Available. 

d. Decrease Max for one process(the process decides it does not need that many resources)
It’s safe all the time. It cannot put the system into unsafe state

e. Increase the number of processes
It’s safe all the time. Increasing the number of processes puts more demand on the system.

f. Decrease the number of processes
It’s safe all the time.


2. OSC 8.13
a. Contiguous memory
the scheme contains external fragmentation problem, however, no internal fragmentation problem since the address spaces are together and holes develop as done processes release its space and new processes is smaller than old one. and it does not allow processes to share code.

b. pure paging
There is no external fragmentation, but there is internal fragmentation, it is able to share code between processes.

c. pure segmentation
There is external fragmentation, but there is no internal fragmentation, it is able to share code between processes.

3 OSC 8.25
a. Memory reference needs two actions of memory accessing, 2*50ns = 100ns

b. 75%(50ns + 2ns) + 25%(100ns + 2ns) = 64.5ns

4. OSC 9.14
a. TLB miss with no page fault
TTLB did not has page table entry, but it did exist in the page table and the entry is valid.

b. TLB miss and page fault
TLB did not has page table entry so it asked the page table but the entry is either invalid or out on disk.

c. TLB hit and no page fault
TLB contained that entry and it was valid and in memory

d. TLB hit and page fault
implies cache inconsistency, The TLB is a cache remember, this could never happen. the TLB is flushed on context switches. So there is no way the TLB can refer to the same page.

5. OSC 9.21
a. LRU replacement
18 page faults
